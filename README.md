Uncovering Patterns in Hotel Booking Data for Operational Efficiency and Revenue Growth

This project involved a deep dive into a real-world hotel booking dataset to uncover valuable patterns for improving operational efficiency and increasing revenue. I acted like a hotel manager, focusing on understanding who books, when, for how long, and what influences pricing.

### **Methodology**

I started with a large dataset containing over 100,000 hotel bookings. The data included booking specifics, guest information, and revenue details.

1.  **Data Cleaning**: The raw data had several challenges, including missing values in columns like "company" and "agent," and dates that were separated into different columns. I handled these issues by filling or dropping missing values and combining the date columns for better time series analysis.
2.  **Analysis**: My analysis was broken down into three key parts:
    * **Univariate Analysis**: I examined single variables to understand basic distributions. For example, I found that most bookings occur 0-20 days before check-in and the Average Daily Rate (ADR) typically falls between \$50 and \$150.
    * **Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis**: I explored the relationships between multiple variables. This analysis revealed that repeat guests and those booking through corporate channels often pay more. It also showed that room reassignments tended to correlate with fewer cancellations.
    * **Time Series Analysis**: I looked at trends over time, discovering that **July and August** are the peak booking months and that **Mondays** have the most bookings.

### **Key Findings and Business Value**

The analysis provided several actionable insights:

* **Pricing and Cancellation Behavior**: I found that lead time and customer type are strong predictors of pricing and cancellation risk.
* **Customer Segmentation**: Guests from countries like the UK and France tend to book earlier and stay longer, while transient guests, despite shorter stays, bring in high revenue.
* **Operational Optimization**: Seasonal trends, like the summer peak and Monday booking surge, can help hotels optimize marketing efforts, staffing, and inventory management.
* **Correlation and Hypothesis Testing**: I used a **correlation heatmap** to find relationships, such as a weak positive link between ADR and special requests. I also used statistical tests to confirm hypotheses, like whether repeat guests pay more than first-timers.

### **Tools Used**

The project was executed using **Python** with libraries like **Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and SciPy**. The entire process was documented and run within a **Jupyter Notebook**.

In conclusion, this project demonstrated how data-driven analysis can provide hotels with crucial information to improve their operational efficiency, enhance customer targeting, and ultimately increase revenue.
